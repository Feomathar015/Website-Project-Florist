          <h5>A sacred sanctuary of serenity.</h5>

          <p class="lead">
            As once the ever stupendous mighty city of Gondolin was a refuge for the last remnants of good in the world,
            that we as one of its sacred houses seek to uphold and shelter the natural wonders that are being gratuitously plundered.
            It is our mission to raise awareness about the importance of a measured co-existence and we must remind ourselves
            that when the balance that existed for inexorably longer than us humans, will at last be devoured through chaos,
            we too will cease to exist. Our means are not boundless however and we must plead with you to join our humble community.
To acquire the necessary resources to support environmental preservation, we will use our sacred gardens and the gifts they offer to share with those that are enchanted with their beauty. Furthermore, since our roots are in the world of fantasy, we are happy
to try to preserve the written works too, we will run fund raising writing competitions, and the winner of these annual events will be able to count on our generosity in a form of our vast social media platform and other contacts which will help them start
a writing carer if they so desire.
