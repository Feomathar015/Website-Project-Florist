          <h2>Battle of Irdorath</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            The Battle of Irdorath is a fictional event from the Gothic video game series, specifically from the time before the events of "Gothic 1", and is mentioned briefly in "Gothic 2". 
            It is a significant battle that takes place in the world of Myrtana, where the forces of Innos, led by the Paladins and Fire Mages, 
            confront the dark forces of Beliar at the temple of Irdorath.
          </p>
       
          
<p>Out of the mist it emerged the dreaded gate to the temple of Irdorath the greatest sanctuary 
of the dark God Beliar, where his immense host of beasts, orcs and demonic spirits which inhabit the 
bodies of both greater and lesser beings dwelt waiting to heed his holy words.</p>

<p>As the royal warship Esmeralda docked near the dark island, a glimmer of scintillating light glassed of the
polished armour of the Paladins, the holy warriors of the God of fire Innos and the pride of King Rhobar the second
ruler of Myrtana.</p>

<p>Before any struggle began a weary silence filled the air, the dark island lived up to its name sake as it was completely barren
devoid of any life. Shadow hung above as the ground and sharp rocks adjacent to their path were as black as coal.
The few decaying trees on the island were corrupted to imbody hideous abominations twisted and horrid as if to mock all 
the creation of Adanos the God of the ethereal and earthly harmony, the very maker of oceans and all live on Earth or Morgrad as it is known.</p>

<p>After what seemed to be an eternity in such a morbidly enchanting place. The host of Myrtana finally reached the gate of Irdorath the dark nexus
within was felt by all those present. However, unbending was their resolve even in the face of such stupendous monuments which were carved
into an incredulous stone fa√ßade in a mountain, where the gate to the temple stood in defiance of Beliars's foes, likeness of his mightiest and most renowned
servants depicted in all their hubris adorning his most precious refuge.
Before the gate of the sanctuary was another gate which led to a repugnant court before Irdorath a sight of calamities and mockery
which served as a yard of various foul foliage within, a sight that the ever chivalrous, chosen servants and priests of Innos deemed down right perverse
to their ideals.</p>

<p>The Paladins under the command of the virtuous Lord Hagen braced themselves for what could pour out of these dreaded gates as the Fire Mages the chosen priests of Innos
considered ways in which to open the gate. They were lead by Archmages Xardas and Pyrokar who would have been viewed as the two of the most
intelligent and omniscient individuals in all of Myrtana, but now they couldn't find a common ground as Xardas mocked Pyrokar for his narrow-minded dogmatic views.
He didn't hold back the insults towards Pyrokar whilst everyone watched in horror.
It would seem that the Paladins were more egger to fight off a horde of demons than listen to the arguments that the mages were throwing as if they were spells.
After a while Lord Hagen tried to reason with the two. However, even someone of his infallible reputation and with his contributions, was quickly shot down from his moral
high ground by those that viewed anyone but themselves as dumb yokels. In any case this had to end, Pyrokar held little trust towards Xardas because of his forbidden studies
of the dark arts and necromancy. Despite that Xardas claimed that only he had the key which he deciphered from long forgotten texts, and it seems Xardas withheld this information only
to make Pyrokar compromise himself and appear as a stumbling fool. Now was his chance Xardas knelt before the gate and let lose the words that shook the souls of all those
gathered behind him. In his deep grizzled voice he said "Khadosh Emem Khadar!" And the gates to what must have been Hell on Earth unravelled.</p>

<p>From the red fog the armies of Beliar came forth to battle Hagen in the abhorrent court in front of Irdorath. First lunged the wargs which would have easily clenched the necks of their victims 
if it wasn't for the marvellous plated armour that the Paladins were truly lucky to posses, all of this evened out the odds for the host of Innos numbering a mere measly one thousand of the most 
elite troops, were now outnumbered five to one. But clanging onto their two handed longswords blessed by their God and with the name of their lord on their lips, they've butchered inexorable 
amounts of the orcs that came after. Sensing an ignominious defeat imminent, demons and the undead spilled out onto the field. They were by far the toughest of fiends that troubled Hagen, but after 
even they were being slain and the victory was just a matter of time, the temple of Irdorath simply vanished! It was Beliar himself who used a tremendous degree of his innate power to shield the 
temple and all secrets guarded within in the realm of the unseen separated from the physical world.</p>

<p>Victorious yet unsatisfied the host of Innos had to return to their ships to then sail back to their homeland of Myrtana a truly magnificent monument of their superiority above all their foes. 
Now all the survivors a mournful half of those who came longed to separate themselves from the presence of the island and to at last enjoy their well earned rest. And rest they should for Beliar 
was weakened but he will return mightier than ever before. Now, no one knew what happened to the temple and when and where it will resurface, but one thing is clear Myrtana will not be idle.</p>
